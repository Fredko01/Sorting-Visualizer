# Sorting Visualization

This is a web-app to visualize some common sorting algorithms, which are:

1. Insertion sort
2. Selection sort
3. Bubble sort
4. Quick sort
5. Merge sort

The size of the Array can be varied between 1 and 200. The Array holds Objects with a number of 1 to 100 (the height in %) and a color (the color of the bar).

Possible colors are:

1. blue: default
2. light blue: selected
3. purple: sorted but the bar might not be at the correct position or selected.
4. green: sorted and the bar is at the correct position.

The speed of the sorting algorithms can be varied between 1 and 300, which is a delay in ms. The speed can be varied while the sorting algorithm is running.

To stop a sorting algorithm, one of the sorting algorithm buttons must be clicked e.g.: INSERTION SORT.
